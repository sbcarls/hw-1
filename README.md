# hw1-code-refactor

## This homework assignment focused on code refactoring of a pre-existing html and css file. What I did: replaced divs with semantic elements, added a nav bar to the header, increased accessibility by adding alt text to images, and grouped together tags with similar CSS styling to reduce repeated information.
